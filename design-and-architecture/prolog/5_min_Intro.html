<center><h2>Facts, Rules and Queries</h2></center>

<h3>Symbols</h3>

<p>Prolog expressions are comprised of the following truth-functional
symbols, which have the same interpretation as in the predicate
calculus.

</p><blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th>English</th> <th>Predicate Calculus</th>  <th>PROLOG</th>
</tr><tr>
  <th>and</th><th>^</th>     <th>,</th>

<tr>
  <th>or</th><th>v</th>     <th>;</th>

<tr>
  <th>if</th><th>--&gt;</th>     <th>:-</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>not</th><th>~</th>     <th>not</th>
</tr>
  
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<h3>Variables and Names</h3>

Variables begin with an uppercase letter. Predicate names, function
names, and the names for objects must begin with a lowercase letter.
Rules for forming names are the same as for the predicate calculus.

<pre>    mother_of
    male
    female
    greater_than
    socrates
</pre>

<h3>Facts</h3>

A <b>fact</b> is a predicate expression that makes a declarative
statement about the problem domain.  Whenever a variable occurs in a
Prolog expression, it is assumed to be <b>universally quantified</b>.
Note that all Prolog sentences must end with a period.

<blockquote>
<pre>likes(john, susie).                   /* John likes Susie */
likes(X, susie).                      /* Everyone likes Susie */
likes(john, Y).                       /* John likes everybody */
likes(john, Y), likes(Y, john).       /* John likes everybody and everybody likes John */
likes(john, susie); likes(john,mary). /* John likes Susie or John likes Mary */
not(likes(john,pizza)).               /* John does not like pizza */
likes(john,susie) :- likes(john,mary)./* John likes Susie if John likes Mary.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Rules</h3>

A <b>rule</b> is a predicate expression that uses logical implication
(:-) to describe a relationship among facts. Thus a Prolog rule takes
the form

<pre>   left_hand_side :- right_hand_side .
</pre>

<p>This sentence is interpreted as: <i>left_hand_side <b>if</b>
right_hand_side</i>.  The <b>left_hand_side</b> is restricted to a
<b>single, positive, literal</b>, which means it must consist of a
positive atomic expression. It cannot be negated and it cannot contain
logical connectives.  

</p><p> This notation is known as a <b>Horn clause</b>.  In Horn clause
logic, the left hand side of the clause is the conclusion, and must be
a single positive literal. The right hand side contains the premises.
The Horn clause calculus is equivalent to the first-order predicate
calculus.

</p><p>Examples of valid rules:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>friends(X,Y) :- likes(X,Y),likes(Y,X).            /* X and Y are friends if they like each other */
hates(X,Y) :- not(likes(X,Y)).                    /* X hates Y if X does not like Y. */
enemies(X,Y) :- not(likes(X,Y)),not(likes(Y,X)).  /* X and Y are enemies if they don't like each other */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples of invalid rules:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>left_of(X,Y) :- right_of(Y,X)                     /* Missing a period */
likes(X,Y),likes(Y,X) :- friends(X,Y).            /* LHS is not a single literal */
not(likes(X,Y)) :- hates(X,Y).                    /* LHS cannot be negated */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Queries</h3>

The Prolog interpreter responds to <b>queries</b> about the facts and rules
represented in its database. The database is assumed to represent what is
true about a particular problem domain. In making a query you are asking
Prolog whether it can prove that your query is true. If so, it answers
"yes" and displays any <b>variable bindings</b> that it made in coming up
with the answer. If it fails to prove the query true, it answers "No". 

<p> Whenever you run the Prolog interpreter, it will <b>prompt</b> you
with <b>?-</b>.  For example, suppose our database consists of the 
following facts about a fictitious family.

</p><blockquote>
<pre>father_of(joe,paul).
father_of(joe,mary).
mother_of(jane,paul).
mother_of(jane,mary).
male(paul).
male(joe).
female(mary).
female(jane).
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>We get the following results when we make queries about this
database. (I've added comments, enclosed in /*..*/, to interpret each query.)

<p><b>Closed World Assumption.</b> The Prolog interpreter assumes that
the database is a <b>closed world</b> -- that is, if it cannot prove
something is true, it assumes that it is false. This is also known as
<b>negation as failure</b> -- that is, something is false if PROLOG
cannot prove it true given the facts and rules in its database. In
this case, in may well be (in the real world), that Paul is the father
of Mary, but since this cannot be proved given the current family
database, Prolog concludes that it is false. So PROLOG assumes that
its database contains complete knowledge of the domain it is being
asked about.



</p><h3>Prolog's Proof Procedure</h3>

In responding to queries, the Prolog interpreter uses a
<b>backtracking</b> search, similar to the one we study in Chapter 3
of Luger.  To see how this works, let's add the following rules to our
database:

<pre>   parent_of(X,Y) :- father_of(X,Y).       /* Rule #1 */
   parent_of(X,Y) :- mother_of(X,Y).       /* Rule #2 */
</pre>

<p>And let's trace how PROLOG would process the query. Suppose the
facts and rules of this database are arranged in the order
in which they were input. This trace assumes you know how
<a href="http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~ram/cpsc352/notes/unification.html#unify">unification</a> works.

</p><pre>   ?- parent_of(jane,mary).
</pre>

<pre>  parent_of(jane,mary)     /* Prolog starts here and searches
                              for a matching fact or rule. */
    parent_of(X,Y)         /* Prolog unifies the query with the rule #1
                              using {jane/X, mary/Y}, giving
                              parent_of(jane,mary) :- father_of(jane,mary) */
    father_of(jane,mary)   /* Prolog replaces LHS with RHS and searches. */
                           /* This fails to match father_of(joe,paul) and  
                              and father_of(joe,mary), so this FAILS. */
                           /* Prolog BACKTRACKS to the other rule #2 and
                              unifies with {jane/X, mary/Y}, so it matches
                              parent_of(jane,mary) :- mother_of(jane,mary) */
    mother_of(jane,mary)   /* Prolog replaces LHS with RHS and searches. */
                       
    YES.                   /* Prolog finds a match with a literal and so succeeds.
</pre>

<p>Here's a trace of this query using Prolog's <b>trace</b> predicate:

</p><pre>| ?- trace,parent_of(jane,mary).
{The debugger will first creep -- showing everything (trace)}
   1  1  Call: parent_of(jane,mary) ?
   2  2  Call: father_of(jane,mary) ?
   2  2  Fail: father_of(jane,mary) ?
   2  2  Call: mother_of(jane,mary) ?
   2  2  Exit: mother_of(jane,mary) ?
   1  1  Exit: parent_of(jane,mary) ?

yes
{trace}
| ?-
</pre>
